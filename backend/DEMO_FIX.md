# 🚀 Demo Fix: Correct Usage Instructions

## ❌ The Issue You Encountered

You ran the demo from the root `kinect` directory, but the demo scripts are in the `backend` workspace.

**Error Message:**
```
npm error Missing script: "demo:reminders"
```

## ✅ Correct Usage

### Option 1: Run from Backend Directory (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Run the demo
npm run demo:reminders
```

### Option 2: Run from Root Using Workspace Commands

```bash
# From the root kinect directory
npm run demo:reminders --workspace=backend
```

### Option 3: Quick Demo (Always Works)

```bash
# From the backend directory
cd backend
npm run demo:quick
```

## 🎉 Success! Demo Working
