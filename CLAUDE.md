# Kinect Project Context for AI Assistants

## Project Overview

Kinect is a privacy-first, self-hosted relationship management application designed to help users maintain meaningful connections with friends and loved ones. It tracks communication patterns and sends timely reminders to encourage regular contact.

**üîí Privacy-First**: 100% local deployment with no cloud dependencies
**üõ°Ô∏è Error-Resilient**: Enterprise-grade error handling with automatic retry mechanisms
**üè† Self-Hosted**: Complete Docker-based deployment for personal use

## Key Concepts

- **Relationship Categories**: Best Friends (30-day reminder), Friends (90-day reminder), Acquaintances (180-day reminder), Custom
- **Communication Tracking**: Manual logging with automated reminders based on last contact dates
- **Multi-platform**: Web application with PWA support, containerized backend
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries, retry logic, and user feedback systems
- **Self-Hosted**: Docker Compose deployment with MongoDB, Node.js backend, React frontend

## Architecture

The project follows a containerized multi-tier architecture:

- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB with health checks and backup capabilities
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Proxy Layer**: Nginx for static serving and API proxying
- **Shared Module**: Common TypeScript types and utilities
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries, retry mechanisms, and monitoring

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization

- Backend code goes in `/backend/` with subdirectories for api, models, services, and config
- Web frontend code goes in `/frontend-web/`
- Shared types and interfaces go in `/shared/` (built for both CommonJS and ESM)
- Error handling components in `/frontend-web/src/components/common/`
- Utility functions for retry logic and error reporting in `/frontend-web/src/utils/`
- Docker configurations for self-hosted deployment

### API Design

- RESTful API design patterns with comprehensive error responses
- JWT-based authentication with refresh token support
- Request deduplication to prevent duplicate operations
- Exponential backoff retry logic for network failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Proper HTTP status codes and error message standardization

### Database Schema

Key entities to implement:

- Users (authentication, profile)
- Contacts (name, birthday, category, last_contact_date)
- Contact Lists (user's organized groups)
- Notification Settings (per-category intervals)
- Communication Logs (phone call records)

### Security Considerations

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Request minimal permissions for phone log access
- Follow GDPR/CCPA compliance guidelines
- Never store raw phone numbers or call content

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Error handling and boundary testing
- Retry mechanism validation
- Docker health check verification
- Manual testing scenarios documented in QUICKSTART.md

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize database queries for contact list retrieval
- Implement pagination for large contact lists
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Efficient notification scheduling (batch processing)

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Update the database schema if needed
2. Implement backend API endpoints
3. Add frontend components and views
4. Update iOS app if applicable
5. Write tests for new functionality
6. Update documentation

### Working with Notifications

- Use Firebase Cloud Messaging or OneSignal
- Implement batch scheduling to avoid overwhelming users
- Allow users to customize notification preferences
- Include unsubscribe/snooze options

### Integrating Phone Logs

- Request appropriate permissions on iOS
- Use CallKit framework for iOS
- Implement privacy-preserving sync mechanism
- Only store necessary metadata (timestamp, contact identifier)

## Development Commands

curl http://localhost:3000/api/health    # Backend health via proxy
```

### Backup & Maintenance
```bash
# Manual backup
docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhosted.yml exec mongodb mongodump --out /backups

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhosted.yml logs -f [service-name]

# Restart specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhosted.yml restart [service-name]
```

## Testing the Enhanced Application

### Form Validation Testing
1. Navigate to any form (Add Contact, Register, etc.)
2. Submit with empty required fields
3. **Expected**: Clear error messages with icons appear
4. **Expected**: Form submission is blocked until errors are resolved

### Network Resilience Testing
1. Create a contact successfully
2. Disconnect internet briefly
3. Attempt another operation (edit/create contact)
4. **Expected**: "Request failed. Retrying..." toast appears
5. **Expected**: Operation succeeds automatically when connection restored

### Error Boundary Testing
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console
2. Execute: `window.__debugErrors.testError("Test boundary")`
3. **Expected**: Error boundary displays with retry option
4. **Expected**: Retry button restores normal functionality

### Debug Tools Testing
1. In Console: `window.__debugErrors.showErrors()`
2. **Expected**: Complete error history display
3. Execute: `window.__debugErrors.downloadErrorReport()`
4. **Expected**: Downloads comprehensive error report JSON

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Bulk Operations**: Create multiple contacts rapidly
2. **Network Interruption**: Test during various operations
3. **Invalid Data**: Submit malformed data to test validation
4. **Concurrent Actions**: Perform multiple actions simultaneously

All testing scenarios are documented and verified in `QUICKSTART.md` with step-by-step instructions.
