## üåü **Why We Built Kinect**

In our hyper-connected digital world, it's paradoxically easy to lose touch with the people who matter most. Social media gives us the illusion of connection, but meaningful relationships require intentional, consistent effort.

Kinect was born from the frustration of:
- Forgetting to check in with old friends
- Losing touch with former colleagues  
- Feeling guilty about neglected relationships
- Struggling to maintain work-life relationship balance

**Our mission**: Make it effortless to maintain meaningful relationships by removing the mental overhead of tracking and remembering to reach out.
